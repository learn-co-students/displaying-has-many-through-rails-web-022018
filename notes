recipie = Recipie.new(title: params[:recipie][:title], caliroes: params[:recipie][:caliroes])  <-this is called mass assignment

same as strong params:

recipie = Recipie.new(recipie_params)                       <-this is strong params
private
def recipie_params
  params.require(:recipie).permit(:title,caliroes)
end
**************
the 2 different ways are the same becasue in the first one we pick and choose what is assigned
in the 2nd way, we pass in a hash of preassigned(preapproved) values
the first one is also preapproved, just in the same line.


if for mdoesnt need to wrap aroudn obejct use form_tag rather than for_for
